# Bearly Dancing
A rhythm rpg with randomly generated beatmaps, written in python using the pygame library. Journey through a quirky world, playing the music for dance battles between a bear and his foes.

## Setting up the environment

Download a version of python 3.
Run setup.py. Do not run setup.py from IDLE, because there seems to be a bug that causes ultra-slow download speeds.

To play the game without development features, set exportmode in variables.py to True.

## Making an executable

Make the absolute path go back one folder for Windows, and two for Mac in variables.py.
Call python build.py build on Windows or python build.py bdist_mac for Mac.
A folder called build should appear.
