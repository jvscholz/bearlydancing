# Bearly Dancing
A rhythm rpg with randomly generated beatmaps, written purely in python using the pygame library. To play the game without development features, set exportmode in variables.py to True.

## Setting up the environment

Download a version of python 3.
Run setup.py

## Making an executable

Call python build.py build.
A folder called build should appear.
Add the correct font to the library folder if there is an error.
Copy the pics folder over to the folder with the exe file in it,
which is a pain but will be fixed in the future.
