# Bearly Dancing
A rhythm rpg with randomly generated beatmaps, written purely in python using the pygame library.

## Setting up the environment

Download a version of python 3 and add it to PATH.

Call pip install on necessary libraries: numpy, pygame, cx_Freeze

## Making an executable

Call python setup.py build and a folder called build should appear.
Add the correct font to the library folder if there is an error.
Copy the pics folder over to the folder with the exe file in it,
which is a pain but will be fixed in the future.
