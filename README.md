# Bearly Dancing
A rhythm rpg with randomly generated beatmaps, written in python using the pygame library. Journey through a quirky world, playing the music for dance battles between a bear and his foes.

## Setting up the environment

Download a version of python 3.
Run setup.py. Do not run setup.py from IDLE, because there seems to be a bug that causes ultra-slow download speeds.

To play the game without development features, set exportmode in variables.py to True.

## Making an executable

Call python build.py build.
A folder called build should appear.
Add the correct font to the library folder if there is an error.
Copy the pics folder over to the folder with the exe file in it,
which is a pain but will be fixed in the future.
