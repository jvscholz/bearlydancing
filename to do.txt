battle
-melodicmode:
	-sync up durations of melodic notes, ones in a line should be shorter
	-melodicvalue uses randomlast, maybe it should use the melody line instead, the front of each layer (chords added behind)

-repeatbig, and aditional layer of repetition for a large phrase with variation
-repeatwithvariation more sophisticated- switch notes, offset by a beat
