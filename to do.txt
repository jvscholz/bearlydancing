battle
-melodicmode:
	-sync up durations of melodic notes, ones in a line should be shorter
	-melodicvalue uses randomlast, maybe it should use the melody line instead, the front of each layer (chords added behind)
	-better restp function, currently just a 1/9 chance of a rest
-repeatwithvariation, switch notes, offset by a beat
-triplet chord mode
-octaves rule
-dual notes rule- every note doubled, 2 notes apart
-better drum machine
-shape different for ones on offbeats
-note time ordered bug with repetition

-battle code is ugly and convoluted with all the time/health variables
