-chimney wing sounds
-add new scales
-different drums for different enemies

battle
-melodicmode:
	-sync up durations of melodic notes, ones in a line should be shorter
	-melodicvalue uses randomlast, maybe it should use the melody line instead, the front of each layer (chords added behind)
	-better restp function, currently just a 1/9 chance of a rest
-repeatbig, and aditional layer of repetition for a large phrase with variation
-repeat alternating- a-b pattern
-repeatwithvariation more sophisticated- switch notes, offset by a beat
-triplet chord mode
-octaves rule
-dual notes rule- every note doubled, 2 notes apart
-better drum machine
-note time ordered bug with repetition

-battle code is ugly and convoluted with all the time/health variables

graphics
-make conversation appear above if sheep is on bottom of screen
-more complex asthetic background grass
-bush
-flower
-collide with path maybe for placing objects
-shift pixels for wind? give life to the game
-randomly generated faces for bugo- simple one half of smile, pixels are expressive

Sophie:
