Bearly Dancing To-Do List

-auto-save

-expand the map!
-write some tests for once
-flying chimney once sophie makes it
-controls in menu
-map objects and loading more safely, versioning, safely load with new content

-fix volume
-add music
-load own sounds using the bowl pianoputer as example
-chimney wing sounds

battle
-melodicmode:
	-sync up durations of melodic notes, ones in a line should be shorter
	-melodicvalue uses randomlast, maybe it should use the melody line instead, the front of each layer (chords added behind)
	-better restp function, currently just a 1/9 chance of a rest
-repeatwithvariation, switch notes, offset by a beat
-triplet chord mode
-octaves rule
-dual notes rule- every note doubled, 2 notes apart
-better drum machine
-shape different for ones on offbeats

-battle code is ugly and convoluted with all the time/health variables

graphics
-more complex asthetic background grass
-bush
-flower
-collide with path maybe for placing objects
-shift pixels for wind?

Sophie:
-forest boss

-wardrobe open, "why do I even have this?"
