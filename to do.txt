Bearly Dancing To-Do List

bugs
-"l" note was the same note as "a", which cannot be correct

gameplay
-knomi code name- bear winks at you
-map objects and loading more safely, versioning, safely load with new content
-random star character- one side of leg longer than other so it looks funny
-ddr machine that you can play and dance against
- make jeremy fightable after completion of snow area
- story needs more jokes, more references- nani, you beat my best brother jeremy???!
-different volume envelopes
- zoom button, rescaling funciton

sound
-load own sounds using the bowl pianoputer as example
      -random generation of wave?
- different drums for different enemies, multiple drum samples
  - which wave to start with
  - chance to flip sign with noise
  - variance in how much it changes it with noise
  - less random noise? some sort of wave of noise
  - add noise vs multiply by it
- save to midi, sheet music

battle
- battle code is ugly and convoluted with all the time/health variables

- melodicmode:
	-sync up durations of melodic notes, ones in a line should be shorter
	-better restp function, currently just a 1/9 chance of a rest
- repeatwithvariation more sophisticated- switch notes, offset by a beat. Different types of repeatwithvariation?

rules ideas

- dual notes rule- every note doubled, 2 notes apart
- triplet mode only for some enemies
- repeating with variation chance to redo all of the rest of the notes, especially halfway through or power of 2
- two simple melodies, then both at same time
- left hand repeats while right is a song
- long chord mode with a note being held with stuff around it



Knob ideas for the beatmap generator

- sway pitch to higher or lower for different enemies
  - idea of center?
  - triangle modified probability distruibution?
- sway probabilities for repeating at different lengths, and the size of these repetitions



graphics
-shift pixels for wind? give life to the game


Sophie:
-tent snow
-wardrobe open, "why do I have this?"
